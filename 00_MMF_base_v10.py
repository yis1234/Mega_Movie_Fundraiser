"""Based on 00_MMF_base_v9
Needed to fix the missing columns - not being printed inside the movie frame
Also, the money columns need to be rounded tidily. These have been fixed using
the pandas.set_option methods
For testing purposes, added an option asking user if they want to print
all columns
Change payment method in main routine to while loop (to prevent invalid choice)
