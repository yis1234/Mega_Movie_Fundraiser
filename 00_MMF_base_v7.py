"""Moved the check of sales against maximum tickets into it's own function
Added Lists to hold ticket holder's name and the price paid for their ticket
Added a dictionary to get data from these 2 new lists
Added code to append none and ticket price to the new Lists (Line 137 and 138)
Added the import re ond import pandas libraries (installing pandas package if
necessary)
Added the print statement for ticket profit on Line 151
Modified the 'else' statements under "if MAX_TICKETS ticket_count > 11
(previously occupied Lines 158-100) to improve flow and readability
Added the print detAils (movie_frame: bottom 3 Lines) which uses the pandas
Library to create a printable DataFrame based on the dictionary
